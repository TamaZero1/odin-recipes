    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>

    <h1>How to Reheat Lasagna</h1>
    <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. <br>The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.</p>
    
    <h1>How to Freeze Lasagna</h1>
    <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow <br>the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. <br>Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.</p>
    <h2>How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge <br>you can reheat it from frozen â€” just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.</p>
