    <h1>Homemade Lasagna Sheets</h1>
    <p>
        Homemade lasagna noodles are easier to make than you think, and you don't even need a pasta machine.
        Forget about blanching the sheets before baking-no precooking is required!

            <p></p>Gently beat eggs with a fork, incorporating surrounding flour until the mixture is runny.
            <br>Bring in the remaining flour with a bench scraper until dough forms a ball.
            <br>Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.<br>

            Knead dough by flattening, stretching, and folding the top toward the center.
            <br>Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p></p>Shape dough into a ball, place in a bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.
            Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br>

        <li>
            <p> Divide dough into 3 equal portions. 
                Take one piece and flatten it a bit with your hands. 
                <br>Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. 
                <br>Turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to 6 times. 
                <br>Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly very thin. <br>When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your fingers through it.</p>
